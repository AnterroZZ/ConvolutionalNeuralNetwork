# ConvolutionalNeuralNetwork
Notebook shows the step by step training of simple Convolutional Neural Network. It shows the usage of ImageDataGenerator and augmentation. Model is sequentional with few Convolutions and MaxPooling layers. It also contains Dropout layers to easily prevent model from overfitting.
